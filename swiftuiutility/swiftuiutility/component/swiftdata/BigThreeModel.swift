 1. ModelContainer is responsible for creating and managing the actual database file used for all SwiftDataâ€™s storage needs.
 2. ModelContext has the job of tracking all objects that have been created, modified, and deleted in memory, so they can all be saved to the model container at some later point.
 3. ModelConfiguration determines how and where data is stored, including which CloudKit container to use if any, and whether saving should be enabled or not. This configuration is provided to your model container to determine how it behaves.
